              Hello! Thanks for checking out my porrtfolio website. My name is
              Chris Tzitzas and I'm a 34 year old student currently studying at
              Coder Academy to become a full stack developer. I'm currently
              living in Melbourne but I'm a country boy at heart.
            </p>

            />
            <p>
              I have worked in hospitality in hospitality since I was 16 years
              old. I started off as a dishwasher but worked my up and developed
              a lot of skills along the way. I've worked front of house as a
              waiter and bartender but i've mainly worked at back of house as a
              cook, i've also held manager positions. I have been in the
              hospitality industry for almost 20 years and I really enjoyed it
              because i love working with food and customers. However, I'm in
              need of a change and i want a more challenging careeer. <br />
              <br />
              I went to Colac High School and graduated year 12 in 2004. I have
              since tried studying a couple of times since, the most notable was
              i did 3 years of a bachelors degree in civil engineerinf at
              Swinburne University. Although I enjoyed the maths, physics and
              problem solving nature of the course, i didnt finish it because
              the later part of the course made me realise that it wasn't the
              career for me.

            />
            <p>
              My most favourite activitiy is going snowboarding. I have done
              multiple overseas trips and countless domestic trips and i just
              can't get enough. I also skateboard when there's no snow around. I
              really enjoy these activities because they make me push myself and
              progress. I enjoy being pushed out of comfort zone trying to learn
              something new. <br />
              <br />I also realy enjoy coding! I've been teachin myself since I
              first learned coding as part of the civil engineering degree i
              started. I recently purchased a raspberry pi and starting coding
              with python to control various electronics.
